Unlike mechanically restrictive price feed oracles, an optimistic oracle is able to serve any arbitrary data on-chain. UMAâ€™s flexible oracle serves data for uses including a cross-chain bridge, insurance, custom derivatives and prediction markets among other things. The UMA Protocol also provides various smart contract templates that are automatically secured by its optimistic oracle. Among these are contract templates and integrations for creating synthetic tokens, predictions markets, \"KPI options\" and structured financial products.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Anyone, anywhere in the world can secure the oracle.</li>\n<li>Full recourse for inaccurate or manipulated data. Don't get burned by a bad feed.</li>\n<li>Contracts secured by UMA have economic guarantees equal to the value of the entire UMA ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Request any arbitrary data to power your protocol</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Team</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Name</th>\n<th align=\"right\">Position</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Jesper Gisslen</td>\n<td align=\"right\">CEO</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Reinis Martinsons</td>\n<td align=\"right\">CTO</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Hart Lambaur</td>\n<td align=\"right\">Co-founder</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://umaproject.org/\">WEBISTE</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/UMAprotocol\">TWITTER</a></p>","network":"ethereum","category":"web3","slug":"uma"},"__N_SSG":true}

Shared ownership in the DAO incentivizes builders to have aligned objectives. Whilst decentralized governance ensures that those incentives remain fair to all parties and that the projects pursued are determined by the community.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Anyone who holds its governance token, BADGER, has the ability to vote on proposals set forth by members of the community.</li>\n<li>Leaving control and decisions to the community of how to best distribute and utilize a significant portion of token supply.</li>\n<li>Badger has integrated multiple DeFi products into its platform to help make bitcoin a usable asset across blockchains.</li>\n<li>When users deposit tokens into a SETT, they receive bTokens in return.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Docs</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmSSqaXK2p2AvUgFgewxLaEL6yKDAXBvbh5B45gKLRmSE8\">AUDITS</a></p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://app.badger.finance/\">WEBISTE</a>\n<a href=\"https://t.me/badger_dao\">TELEGRAM</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/badgerdao\">TWITTER</a></p>","network":"ethereum","category":"yield-aggregator","slug":"badger-dao"},"__N_SSG":true}

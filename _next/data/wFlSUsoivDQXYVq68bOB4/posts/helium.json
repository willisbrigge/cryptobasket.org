The blockchain runs on a new consensus protocol, called the Helium Consensus Protocol, and a new kind of proof, called Proof-of-Coverage. The Miners who are providing wireless network coverage in a cryptographically verified physical location and time submit proofs to the Helium network, and the Miners submitting the best proofs are elected to an asynchronous byzantine fault tolerant consensus group at a fixed epoch.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The People's Network is built on Open Source technology and governed by an open alliance.</li>\n<li>Say goodbye to expensive cell contracts. On Helium a sensor can cost cents to run a year.</li>\n<li>Utilize thousands of existing sensors, chipsets and MCUs for streamlined development.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Docs</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/Qma1gm3xC74GLcVtp4umzmzCbWvaqP6Wj3dMthkkV8NaV5\">WHITEPAPER</a></p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.helium.com\">WEBISTE</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/helium\">TWITTER</a>\n<a href=\"https://t.me/helium_network\">TELEGRAM</a></p>","network":"helium","category":"web3","slug":"helium"},"__N_SSG":true}

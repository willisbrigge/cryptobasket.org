This is the only lottery system built directly into an Ethereum token- the token IS the lottery. Unlike a traditional lottery where players have to continuously buy tickets for every drawing, LOTTO focuses on simplicity- just acquire the token, hold, and you'll automatically be entered into the lottery each week.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>LOTTO is immutable, meaning that the lottery will run continuously and no third party can stop it from occurring.</li>\n<li>The winner receives 90% of the LOTTO for the lottery, while the remaining 10% is distributed to the user who calls startGame().</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Team</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Name</th>\n<th align=\"right\">Position</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Tyler Fallon</td>\n<td align=\"right\">CEO</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Ian Arden</td>\n<td align=\"right\">Chief Engineer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Ty Smith</td>\n<td align=\"right\">Marketing Campaign Manager</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Jared Maldonado</td>\n<td align=\"right\">Marketing Campaign Coordinator</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lotto.finance\">WEBISTE</a>\n<a href=\"https://t.me/LottoFinance\">TELEGRAM</a></p>","network":"ethereum","category":"gambling","slug":"lotto"},"__N_SSG":true}

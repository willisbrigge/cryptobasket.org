Compound is a protocol on the Ethereum blockchain that establishes money markets, which are pools of assets with algorithmically derived interest rates, based on the supply and demand for the asset. Suppliers (and borrowers) of an asset interact directly with the protocol, earning (and paying) a floating interest rate, without having to negotiate terms such as maturity, interest rate, or collateral with a peer or counterparty.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Can earn 4% APR on USD balances without any of complexities of crypto.</li>\n<li>Access compound directly from the security of your hardware wallet.</li>\n<li>Allows users to deposit cryptocurrency into lending pools for access by borrowers.</li>\n<li>Borrowing assets from the Compound Protocol has no time-duration; balances can be repayed at anytime, while interest is accumulating per block on the Ethereum network.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Docs</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://gateway.ipfs.io/QmdwXfKdBnFWk2FRi2xGk1wvzqUtWCXhZCrGgcF79HN9Bk\">AUDITS</a>\n<a href=\"https://gateway.ipfs.io/QmZaBPgk1E7dzQccKLTCcfPLqwATfwbJad69gx9HBbww7s\">WHITEPAPER</a></p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://compound.finance/governance/comp\">WEBISTE</a>\n<a href=\"https://compound.finance/discord\">DISCORD</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/compoundfinance\">TWITTER</a></p>","network":"ethereum","category":"defi","slug":"compound"},"__N_SSG":true}

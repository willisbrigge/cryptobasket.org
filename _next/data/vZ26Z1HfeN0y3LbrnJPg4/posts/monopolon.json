Players use NFT to represent them and move around the board to get rewards, pvp, fight bosses and join guild wars. Monopolon also have virtual lands and buildings for players to own and create a Metaverse for the future.</p>\n<p>Monopolon is designed to attract both worlds, the blockchain-powered decentralized ecosystem where gamers’ actions determine the development of the game using a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO), as well as the pure gaming and competitive aspect of finding the best strategy, best team, and climbing the leaderboards to win sky-high rewards from the game.</p>\n<h2>Mission</h2>\n<p>A game accessible to everyone, with low entry costs with even free NFTs, and provides players, suppliers, and investors with the ability to generate income based on \"playformance\". To make everyone a winner with Monopolon.</p>\n<h2>Vision</h2>\n<p>We aim to become the next leading gamefi metaverse, a futuristic play-to-earn NFT game in the blockchain industry while providing gamers an NFT-gaming experience that is finally worth their time.</p>\n<h2>Game Features</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Factions: Musketeers - Raiding is 5% more efficient Amazonians - 1 extra item appears in the shop per visit, Shop items are 5% cheaper Bynans - Mining is 5% more efficient Jackknights - Extra dice reroll once a day.

However, as we grow older we come to realize that it is not so easy with majority having their entire lives running the rat race.\nThe Monopolon envision ourselves to bring back the simple game that we had grown up with, combine it with a Play-To-Earn model and integrate with exclusive NFTs usable in-game to allow players a user-friendly game that allows multiple channels to make profits. This will create a long-term sustainable game ecosystem where it brings true asset value to the players and a chance for the Underdoge to rise up to become the Lorde Edge from Trollheim.\nRoll a dice, watch the battle unfold before your eyes, and your destiny is in the luck of your roll.</p>\n<h2>Team</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Name</th>\n<th align=\"right\">Position</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Manfred</td>\n<td align=\"right\">Founder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Kacy</td>\n<td align=\"right\">CMO</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Bharat Gandass</td>\n<td align=\"right\">Advisor</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Tokenomics</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Name: Monopolan</li>\n<li>Symbol: $MLON</li>\n<li>Total supply: 100,000,000,000</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmeZLKhzLxHR5HbSDDMgVLx1hiGPH6upxdRBqNcK6R3Y2F\" alt=\"Error\"></p>\n<h2>Docs</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://monopolon.gitbook.io/monopolon-whitepaper\">WHITEPAPER</a></p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.monopolon.io\">WEBSITE</a>\n<a href=\"https://t.me/monopolon\">TELEGRAM</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/monopolondefi\">TWITTER</a></p>","network":"bsc","category":"gamefi","slug":"monopolon"},"__N_SSG":true}

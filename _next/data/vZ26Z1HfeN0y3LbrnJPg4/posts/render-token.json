The Render Network is the first network to transform the power of GPU compute into a decentralized economy of connected 3D assets.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>There is no universally accessible storage location for artists to store their work and know that it is theirs. Through the blockchain and the ledger-based storage protocol of the RNDR network, artists are able to store and access their designs and creations.</li>\n<li>Render envisions a better future, where our network is empowered by the very work that GPUs are designed to do: bringing creative visions to life.</li>\n<li>Protocol calculates the amount of RNDR required to perform the job. Details attached to a smart contract and sent across the Render Network.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Problems Solved</h2>\n<p>Authoring and publishing state-of-the-art graphics is an immense challenge that is growing each day. The future demand for advanced rendering will lead to even more complexity and require higher resolution and more interactivity. Today a large amount of GPU power is used in ‘Proof-of-Work’ mining, where GPUs are used to solve arbitrary arithmetic functions in order to provide the base power and security for their respective crypto networks. But PoW mining is inherently inefficient, and wastes the true power in GPUs.</p>\n<h2>Whitepaper</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmS7npYKTykF3UWee6ZW1awhzeenUxP2EYUJ1aQ22GZBz3\">https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmS7npYKTykF3UWee6ZW1awhzeenUxP2EYUJ1aQ22GZBz3</a></p>\n<h2>Contracts</h2>\n<p>0x6de037ef9ad2725eb40118bb1702ebb27e4aeb24</p>\n<h2>Audits</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.openzeppelin.com/render-token-audit-2a078ba6d759/\">https://blog.openzeppelin.com/render-token-audit-2a078ba6d759/</a></p>\n<h2>Team</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Jules Urbach (Founder)</li>\n<li>Ari Emanuel (Co-founder)</li>\n<li>David Vorick (Developer)</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Token Distribution</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Name</strong> : Render Token</li>\n<li><strong>Symbol</strong> : $RNDR</li>\n<li><strong>Total Supply</strong> : 504,793,762 RNDR</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmfQHisKtQ9zaykMDLiYAy4ApMTj9XcRh16up5PW2riyhN\" alt=\"Error\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<p><strong>Website</strong> : <a href=\"https://rendertoken.com/\">https://rendertoken.com/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Twitter</strong> : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rendertoken\">https://twitter.com/rendertoken</a></p>\n<p><strong>Telegram</strong> : <a href=\"https://t.me/RenderTokenOfficial\">https://t.me/RenderTokenOfficial</a></p>","network":"ethereum","category":"network","slug":"render-token"},"__N_SSG":true}

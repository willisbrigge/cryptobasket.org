Anyone can build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, making data easily accessible. e The Graph, a Decentralized Query Protocol for indexing and caching data from blockchains and storage networks. We describe the query interface, the topology of the P2P network, and the economic incentives and mechanisms designed to keep the network running as a public utility.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Guaranteed to run forever on reliable public infrastructure.</li>\n<li>Transparent rules that people have a voice in.</li>\n<li>All data is stored and processed on open networks with verifiable integrity. The Graph makes querying this data fast, reliable, and secure.</li>\n<li>Entrepreneurs are creating next level apps to scale human coordination on the internet. It's a new frontier and we're just getting started.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Docs</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmZAKLgFwFW1aYkBP4Cwi1E375wHTa8DDRa4pzT2d3f5cc\">WHITEPAPER</a></p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://thegraph.com\">WEBISTE</a>\n<a href=\"https://blog.openzeppelin.com/thegraph-governance-upgrade-audit\">AUDITS</a>\n<a href=\"https://t.me/GraphProtocol\">TELEGRAM</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/graphprotocol\">TWITTER</a></p>","network":"ethereum","category":"analytics","slug":"graph-protocol"},"__N_SSG":true}

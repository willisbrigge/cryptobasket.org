Get your unique snail, compete in races, breed more snails and earn SMILE. Much like Humans every snail has a unique genes. In-game system allow for billions of different genetic sequence, multiple generations and rare species.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Snail owners can earn rewards by entering races and tournaments on the platform, all available in real time for watching.</li>\n<li>Comprehensive in-game reproduction systems allow owners to mint ready to race new offsprings.</li>\n<li>Mint a Genesis Snail and start your racing journey as you compete against other snails in high stakes Competitive Races or fun Daily Missions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Snail Overview</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>A snail belongs to one of five different families: Garden, Helix, Milk, Agate, or the rarest of the snail families; Atlantis.</li>\n<li>Genesis Class snails will be available to mint before the game launch while the other 6 classes will be available in-game.</li>\n<li>The generation of a snail represents how far down a snail is from the first ancestor on its family tree.</li>\n<li>All snails adapt in a unique way to their environment and each one receives an adaptation at random when it is born.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Racing Traits</h2>\n<p>Every Snail is unique. Their performance is defined by 4 different traits which we'll cover in more depth below.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Family :\nSnails can belong to one of 5 different families.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each family has a different letter assigned for its gene.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each snail has 20 genes in its genome. The most dominant gene determines its family.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Both parents randomly pass on 10 genes to the offspring's genetic sequence. For each slot only one parent can provide a gene. For instance, for a Nth slot gene, it can either be female parent's Nth slot gene or male parent's Nth slot gene. See the related image in DNA page.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>While the quantity of genes is important for reproduction, its order in the genetic sequence is not changing the family type.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Class:\nSnails can fall under one of the following 7 classes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Master, Expert, Apprentice, Initiate, and Novice classes will be available in-game anytime.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Genesis and Special classes will be minted to specific users for a specific time period.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Generation:\nThe generation of a snail represents how far down a snail is from the first ancestor on its family tree. A snail can be brought to Earth in two different ways: as an Incubator or a Laboratory snail.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adaption:\nEach snail adapts in a unique way to its environment. However, this does not mean that a Cold Adaptive Snail never performs well in Hot conditions. On average it achieves better results in cold conditions than in any of the other environments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At birth, each snail has only 1 adaptation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Throughout life, a snail can adapt to a total of up to 3 different environments. Increasing adaptation is possible with Adaptation Potion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each Trail can have several conditions which might change on every segment of the trail.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmQe6BhmPS8AzoU4Wqbzj3hx4ndQXtag9pqWaSJfHFU2Ew\" alt=\"Error\"></p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.snailtrail.art/\">WEBSITE</a>\n<a href=\"https://docs.snailtrail.art/\">WHITEPAPER</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://discord.gg/snailtrail\">DISCORD</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SnailTrailGame\">TWITTER</a></p>","network":"avalanche","category":"gaming","slug":"snail-trail"},"__N_SSG":true}

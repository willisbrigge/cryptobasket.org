The OmniaVerse token is a utility token to help strengthen a community that eats, sleeps and breathes Multiverse and crypto using OmniaVerse.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Buy listed artwork as an NFT using Crypto on OpenSea.</li>\n<li>Build artwork for free and sell them as an NFT on OpenSea. Claim your first free sandbox and get an attractive incentive.</li>\n<li>Trade artwork with other artists, once traded, artwork is yours and you get a chance to make it better.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Who is OmniaVerse?</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>We are a group of makers who make cool and innovative blockchain products. We have been active builders in Minecraft community and like us there are a lot of minecraft build artists (Minecraft Builds). Now, Minecraft is just one platform, meta is another one that can house millions of artists too.</li>\n<li>This year, with emerging blockchain platforms and applications, we saw a need to build a platform for artists that create artwork, but this time on Multiverse supporting metaverses flavours like Minecraft and Meta powered by better/effective and economic blockchain providers such as Bitgert, Tron, Ethereum and Binance Chain.</li>\n<li>To make the experience even better, the platform would be integrated with Oculus for a seameless metaverse experience. So whether its imaginary or real, put on your oculus, and start building interesting things on Minecraft or MetaQuest. Once built, either sell or monetize by giving the world an opportunity to experience your creation.</li>\n<li>Our mission is to boost the blockchain adoption by bringing in applications that can fecilitate day to day crypto token usage and promotion, help humans try to transact crypto and not just use it as a stock but on day to day items. And, while doing so, its not a bad idea to go together to the moon.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Objectives</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>OmniaVerse aims to become a moonshot mission by introducing a community driven utility token that allows to keep a self-sufficient liquidity.</li>\n<li>Its exposure to the world is ensured through the teamâ€™s strategic marketing plans, experienced development team and time locked wallet implementations.</li>\n<li>In the initial phases, the goal will be building the community that will join us on the mission of raising OmniaVerse to new heights, thereby creating a better product using a sustainable business model.</li>\n<li>Further down the line, we will expand the OmniaVerse portal implementations by migrating and mirroring OmniaVerse on various other networks without compromising the mission. We also have allocated a good amount of tokens for community reward and incentivization processes.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Tokenomics</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Name: OmniaVerse</li>\n<li>Symbol: $OMNIA</li>\n<li>Max Token Amount: 1,000,000,000</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmYeUwBTJgzJv4D5MmXFtaPp7a6tnNGmb3sVQMHdFdvmnK\" alt=\"Error\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmZ4zyY2857BFazeCibyJX1XygMnd9wXeiDqm5EHh1GqYN\" alt=\"Error\"></p>\n<h2>Docs</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://omniaverse.io/whitepaper.html\">WHITEPAPER</a></p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://omniaverse.io/\">WEBSITE</a>\n<a href=\"https://t.me/omniaverseOfficial\">TELEGRAM</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/omniaverse\">TWITTER</a></p>","network":"bitgert","category":"utility token","slug":"omniaverse"},"__N_SSG":true}

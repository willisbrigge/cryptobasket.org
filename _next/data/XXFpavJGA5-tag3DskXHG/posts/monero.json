The majority of existing cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, have transparent blockchains. Transactions can be verified and/or traced by anyone in the world. This means that the sending and receiving addresses of these transactions could potentially be linked to real-world identities. Unlike selectively transparent alternatives (e.g. Zcash), Monero is the only cryptocurrency where every user is anonymous by default. The sender, receiver, and amount of every single transaction are hidden through the use of three important technologies: Stealth Addresses, Ring Signatures, and RingCT,because every transaction is private, Monero cannot be traced.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Monero is electronic cash that allows fast, inexpensive payments to and from anywhere in the world.</li>\n<li>Monero is a grassroots community attracting the world's best cryptocurrency researchers and engineering talent.</li>\n<li>Monero transactions are confidential and untraceable.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Docs</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmWGqFvNh9ia3LAnvdsztkMELLrQUm7ArgAbJavYx9EsKj\">WHITEPAPER</a></p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.getmonero.org/\">WEBISTE</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/monero\">TWITTER</a>\n<a href=\"https://telegram.me/monero\">TELEGRAM</a></p>","network":"secret","category":"privacy","slug":"monero"},"__N_SSG":true}

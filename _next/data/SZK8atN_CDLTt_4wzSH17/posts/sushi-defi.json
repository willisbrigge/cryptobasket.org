Instead, SushiSwap allows users to trade trustlessly, peer-to-peer, with liquidity that is supplied by other users.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Earn governance rights and 0.05% of all swaps from all chains in one simple place.</li>\n<li>Accelerate your project with onsen.

While other solutions provide incrementally progressive advances toward solving the problem of liquidity, Sushi’s progress is intended to create a broader range of network effects. Rather than limiting itself to a single solution, Sushi intertwines many decentralized markets and instruments. Thus far, the core products, which will be described in more detail here, include a decentralized exchange, a decentralized lending market, yield instruments, and staking derivatives.</p>\n<h2>Contracts</h2>\n<p>0x6b3595068778dd592e39a122f4f5a5cf09c90fe2</p>\n<h2>Tokenomics</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Name</strong> : Sushi</li>\n<li><strong>Symbol</strong> : $SUSHI</li>\n<li><strong>Total Supply</strong> : 250 Million</li>\n<li><strong>Lockup Address</strong> : 2/3rd of $SUSHI</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<p><strong>Website</strong> : <a href=\"https://sushi.com/\">https://sushi.com/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Discord</strong> : <a href=\"https://discord.gg/MsVBwEc\">https://discord.gg/MsVBwEc</a></p>\n<p><strong>Twitter</strong> : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sushiswap\">https://twitter.com/sushiswap</a></p>","category":"defi","slug":"sushi-defi"},"__N_SSG":true}

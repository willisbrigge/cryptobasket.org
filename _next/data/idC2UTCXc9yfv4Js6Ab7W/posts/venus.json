Venus enables users to utilize their cryptocurrencies by supplying collateral to the network that may be borrowed by pledging over-collateralized cryptocurrencies. This creates a secure lending environment where the lender receives a compounded interest rate annually (APY) paid per block, while the borrower pays interest on the cryptocurrency borrowed.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Access an immutable money market directly on-chain.</li>\n<li>All Venus Protocol assets are bound by the BEP-20 standard.</li>\n<li>Built on BNB Chain for fast, secure, and low cost transactions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Docs</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVuQmKpbrvqsRcpPPWe9uhYDSXHYCtNHtiZtA5UHdApDh\">WHITEPAPER</a></p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://venus.io/\">WEBISTE</a>\n<a href=\"https://t.me/VenusProtocol\">TELEGRAM</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/VenusProtocol\">TWITTER</a></p>","network":"bsc","category":"finance","slug":"venus"},"__N_SSG":true}

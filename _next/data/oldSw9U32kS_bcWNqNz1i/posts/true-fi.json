TrueFi allows lenders to earn returns on loaned cryptocurrencies while having full transparency on how the loaned capital is allocated. Vetted borrowers, meanwhile, can use TrueFi for rapid access to fixed-term, fixed-rate cryptocurrency loans. In TrueFi's main lending pools, TRU holders collectively assess the creditworthiness of borrowers and individual loans by staking TRU.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Track every dollar loaned to TrueFiâ€™s vetted borrowers on-chain, and review regular attestations of TRU token treasury.</li>\n<li>TrueFi borrowers complete a thorough onboarding, earn community approval, and sign an enforceable loan agreement.</li>\n<li>TrueFi's TRU holders govern the protocol, approve new borrowers, and influence key treasury &#x26; partnership decisions.</li>\n<li>Lend with no lockup period and deep exit liquidity, giving you ultimate control of your assets.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://truefi.io/\">WEBISTE</a>\n<a href=\"https://blog.trusttoken.com/introducing-truefi-the-defi-protocol-for-uncollateralized-lending-9bfd6594a48\">LITEPAPER</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://t.me/jointruefi\">TELEGRAM</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TrustToken\">TWITTER</a></p>","network":"ethereum","category":"defi","slug":"true-fi"},"__N_SSG":true}

From day 1, Highstreet strives for interoperability and already has major thought leaders from exchanges like Binance, blockchains like AVAX, to funds like Everyrealm and Animoca integrated with our \"metaverse as a service\" layer.</p>\n<p>Beyond crypto projects, brands like Balenciaga and LVMH are extending their reach as well to video games in order to expand new market. With the rise in popularity of NFTs, many brands are further tapping into the on-chain industry Adidas with their very own Bored Ape, and even Harvey Nichols with their own NFT drops. It is without a doubt that the future of retail and commerce is entertainment.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>We already live our life half online and half in real life.

Zcash is the first practical application of zk-SNARKs, a specific type of zero-knowledge proof. Zcash was launched by one of the most respected technical teams in the world. Zcash is the 'https of blockchains,' protecting your freedom to save and spend as you like. Zcash was the first project to implement zk-SNARKs, a novel form of zero-knowledge cryptography that gives its users the strongest privacy available in any digital currency.

Its L2 provides a low-fee, high-speed platform for trading, swapping, liquidity providing, and payments - without sacrificing Ethereum security at all. Loopring builds protocols, infrastructure, and user-facing products for the future of finance. We believe this future is built on Ethereum, and specifically on layer 2 (zkRollups).</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Loopring is an open-sourced, audited, and non-custodial exchange and payment protocol. Nobody in the Loopring ecosystem needs to trust others. zkRollup assures assets are always under users' own control; 100% Ethereum-level security guarantees.</li>\n<li>Loopring powers highly scalable decentralized exchanges and payments by batch-processing thousands of requests off-chain, with verifiably correct execution via ZKPs. The performance of Ethereum is no longer the bottleneck.</li>\n<li>Loopring performs most operations, including trade and transfer settlement, off the Ethereum blockchain. This dramatically reduces gas consumption and overall transaction cost to small fractions of comparable on-chain cost.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Docs</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmR4J1YyXnHc8iqEBvQav5XG5hFhUZZ6CpGaKpiqmt9U4f\">AUDITS</a></p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://loopring.org/\">WEBISTE</a>\n<a href=\"https://t.me/loopring_en\">TELEGRAM</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/loopringorg\">TWITTER</a></p>","network":"ethereum","category":"defi","slug":"loopring"},"__N_SSG":true}

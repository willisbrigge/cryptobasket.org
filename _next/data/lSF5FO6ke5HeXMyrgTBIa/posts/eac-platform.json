Also in terms of timing, during the lockdown brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic that began in 2020, there was a change in learning trend that learning took place exclusively through video media.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The Meta-Economy service layer is a sharing-based, user-based service providing an organic role that breathes life into the platform to enable its own growth.</li>\n<li>We designed a service layer consisting of a special point system that stimulates the growth, maintenance and development of the platform, and the desire for vigorous development of users active in the platform.</li>\n<li>We present a service platform based on cultural education using decentralized blockchain technology to make it a more advanced platform. META-Universe blockchain is designed to use ‘cross chains’ that support key functions in order to promptly establish an ecosystem and minimize trial and error.</li>\n<li>It is a wallet that supports the safe storage and transfer of all coins provided on the platform. In addition to basic functions such as transaction and remittance based on the dApp, a platform for coin exchange with other users (P2P) or at the exchange market shall also be provided in v2.0, thereby evolving into MeXchange platform that users can access more easily.

Built on the Cosmos SDK Oasis Network is a privacy-focused smart contract platform for open finance. The project emphasizes data privacy and user confidentiality applications and use-cases. It tries to do this by isolating its consensus layer from its contract execution layer and offering a built-in interface for privacy-preserving computation between the two. The consensus layer serves as a hub that secures the network and reaches an agreement on transaction legality using a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) method. The execution layer is made up of a number of parallel runtimes (dubbed ParaTimes) for different types of computations that all plug into the consensus layer.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>By bringing privacy and scalability to DeFi, the Oasis Network expands DeFi beyond early adopters to a mass market. It enables private smart contracts, high scalability, and the ability to tokenize data. This unlocks new use cases like private lending, undercollateralized loans, and private automated market makers.</li>\n<li>The Oasis Network’s unique combination of confidential computing and blockchain enables a new paradigm called Tokenized Data. With Tokenized Data users can earn rewards by staking their data with apps that want to analyze it or control how their most sensitive information is consumed by the services they use.</li>\n<li>The Oasis ParaTime scaling architecture supports fast transaction speed, high scalability, and large workloads by separating execution from consensus. Anyone can create their own ParaTime, allowing for the Oasis Network to support a rich ecosystem of applications and use cases.</li>\n<li>The first network to support confidential smart contracts. The Oasis Eth/WASI Runtime is an open source example of a confidential ParaTime that uses secure enclaves to keep data private while being processed.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://oasisprotocol.org/\">WEBISTE</a>\n<a href=\"https://docsend.com/view/aq86q2pckrut2yvq\">WHITEPAPER</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://t.me/oasisprotocolcommunity\">TELEGRAM</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/OasisProtocol\">TWITTER</a></p>","category":"privacy","slug":"oasis-network"},"__N_SSG":true}

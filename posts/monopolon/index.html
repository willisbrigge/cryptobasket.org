<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Monopolon, is the first-ever 3D futuristic gamefi project that has it's concept revolving around the iconic Monopoly game. Players use NFT to represent them and move around the board to get rewards, pvp, fight bosses and join guild wars. Monopolon also have virtual lands and buildings for players to own and create a Metaverse for the future.</p>
<p>Monopolon is designed to attract both worlds, the blockchain-powered decentralized ecosystem where gamers’ actions determine the development of the game using a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO), as well as the pure gaming and competitive aspect of finding the best strategy, best team, and climbing the leaderboards to win sky-high rewards from the game.</p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>A game accessible to everyone, with low entry costs with even free NFTs, and provides players, suppliers, and investors with the ability to generate income based on "playformance". To make everyone a winner with Monopolon.</p>
<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>We aim to become the next leading gamefi metaverse, a futuristic play-to-earn NFT game in the blockchain industry while providing gamers an NFT-gaming experience that is finally worth their time.</p>
<h2>Game Features</h2>
<ol>
<li>Factions: Musketeers - Raiding is 5% more efficient Amazonians - 1 extra item appears in the shop per visit, Shop items are 5% cheaper Bynans - Mining is 5% more efficient Jackknights - Extra dice reroll once a day. Zuckarians - Upgrades are 5% faster.</li>
<li>The Player: The player starts by establishing a base HQ in one of the tiles within their Faction’s space. This is where the player will build their base and upgrade their collection. Whenever another enemy player lands on this tile, they have an option to invade the player’s HQ for resources, if the player successfully defends their HQ for the week, they get to keep the remaining loot at the end of the week.</li>
<li>Mining:  Players can enter the mining game mode from their HQ once a week or by landing on Player Mines. Upon starting the activity, they have a 2 hour window, during which the player can enter a session up to 3 times.</li>
<li>Invasions: Players enter the invasion game mode by choosing to attack an enemy HQ when they land on a Player Mine. Upon starting the activity, they have a 2 hour window, during which they can attack up to 3 different or the same HQs in 5 minute sessions. This timer can be increased with characters having a higher PREP stat.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Game Overview</h2>
<p>During our childhood days, most of us would have the experience of fulfilling our fantasy to become a millionaire using a single board game, two dice &#x26; a whole stack of monopoly money. However, as we grow older we come to realize that it is not so easy with majority having their entire lives running the rat race.
The Monopolon envision ourselves to bring back the simple game that we had grown up with, combine it with a Play-To-Earn model and integrate with exclusive NFTs usable in-game to allow players a user-friendly game that allows multiple channels to make profits. This will create a long-term sustainable game ecosystem where it brings true asset value to the players and a chance for the Underdoge to rise up to become the Lorde Edge from Trollheim.
Roll a dice, watch the battle unfold before your eyes, and your destiny is in the luck of your roll.</p>

## Introduction
Kava is a lightning-fast Layer-1 blockchain featuring a developer-optimized co-chain architecture that combines the two most used permissionless ecosystems - Ethereum and Cosmos - into a single, scalable, network. The Kava Networkâ€™s Co-Chains combine the flexibility and speed of Ethereum smart contract development with the interoperability of the Cosmos SDK in a single network, all powered by the ultra-fast Tendermint consensus engine.

## Features
1. Build and deploy on either of the two most used permissionless execution environments in the world using the EVM-compatible Ethereum Co-Chain or the Cosmos Co-Chain. The choice is yours.
2. A revolutionary, decentralized on-chain incentive model will ensure that the best developers and projects are rewarded in every Web3 vertical including DeFi, GameFi, and NFTs.
3. Deploy Solidity smart contracts that interoperate seamlessly with Cosmos SDK protocols in the same network, connecting your project to every major asset and millions of users.

After successfully transitioning to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism on Wednesday evening, Goerli, the network’s third and final testnet, Ethereum is now in the last steps of getting ready for the eagerly anticipated Merge event. ETH jumped and is at 4% gain within 24 hour of the news. The Ropsten testnet successfully switched to PoS earlier this summer, and the Sepolia testnet followed suit at the start of July. The Goerli testnet merge was announced at the end of July, and it took place in two stages, starting on August 4 with the mandatory Bellatrix upgrade. Today, once the Terminal Total Difficulty (TTD) on the Goerli chain reached 10,790,000, the second stage, known as Paris, was activated.

The Goerli Merge, according to the Ethereum Foundation, is the last chance for users to make sure their PoS validators are set up properly before the mainnet switchover. The Ethereum mainnet is anticipated to formally merge with the Beacon chain next month, with a soft deadline of September 19. It will also act as the last test run until that time. Since the network’s introduction in 2015, The Merge has been Ethereum’s most major update. It will terminate the existing, energy-intensive ETH mining mechanism and replace it with a PoS model, which is anticipated to increase the network’s scalability and make it 99% more environmentally friendly.

It will be interesting to see if a smooth integration will help end the present crypto winter.

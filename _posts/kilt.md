## Introduction

KILT is a simple protocol for creating, claiming, issuing, presenting and verifying digital credentials. In contrast to peer-to-peer solutions for this KILT features self-sovereign data as well as revocable credentials using blockchain technology. It provides a secure way to create, issue, and verify digital credentials.


## Features

1.  KILT Protocol provides a way to represent your identity without revealing things you prefer to keep private. KILT brings the old process of trust in real-world verifiable credentials to the digital world, while keeping your data private and in your possession.
2. Consumers can take a full control of their data, and get Carry tokens (CRE) as a reward for sharing the data and receiving the ads.
3. Advertisers are able to select the ad targets and implement advertisements through analyzing the purchase data on the database.


## Problems Solved

KILT is a decentralized open-source blockchain protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous and verifiable credentials. KILT's mission is to return control over personal data to its owner, restoring privacy to the individual.Nov

## Introduction
Welcome to the world lottery of the future. This is the only lottery system built directly into an Ethereum token- the token IS the lottery. Unlike a traditional lottery where players have to continuously buy tickets for every drawing, LOTTO focuses on simplicity- just acquire the token, hold, and you'll automatically be entered into the lottery each week.

## Features
1. LOTTO is immutable, meaning that the lottery will run continuously and no third party can stop it from occurring. 
2. The winner receives 90% of the LOTTO for the lottery, while the remaining 10% is distributed to the user who calls startGame().

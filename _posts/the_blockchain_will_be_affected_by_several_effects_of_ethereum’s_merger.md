The Ethereum blockchain’s planned Merge, an upgrade that changes it from a proof-of-work (PoW) system to a more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, will have a number of consequences. These include lower energy intensity, the transition into a deflationary asset and a “potential road map to a more scalable future through sharding,” the bank said (Citigroup).

The Merge, the first of five planned network upgrades, may only boost transaction speeds by 10% by cutting down on block times. The “Surge,” the network’s next scheduled upgrade, will provide 100,000 transactions per second (TPS) capabilities to the blockchain, according to the article, but the upgrade paves the way for it. The Merge will reduce block time from 13 to 12 seconds, which might lead to a slight decrease in fees and an increase in speed. Switching from PoW will cut overall issuance of ether by 4.2% annually, which may strengthen the case for the token as a store of value.

Ethereum is less likely to be the blockchain with the largest throughput because it will be yield-bearing and deflationary. As energy consumption is anticipated to drop by 99.95% after the merge, ETH might be seen as a particularly energy-efficient and environmentally beneficial crypto asset, the note continued.

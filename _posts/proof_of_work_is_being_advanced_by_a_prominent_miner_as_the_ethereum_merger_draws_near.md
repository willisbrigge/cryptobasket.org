The community is concerned about the risk of a miner-led fork that could split the network as Ethereum gets closer to switching to proof-of-stake consensus. Chandler Guo, a well-known Chinese investor and miner of cryptocurrencies, said last week on Twitter that he would fork the Ethereum blockchain into something he named “ETH POW,” allowing miners to continue their activities after the merge. This gave the concept new momentum. The merge, which is anticipated to take place in the next months, would change Ethereum’s consensus method from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). That will do away with the requirement for miners, who have invested billions of dollars in purchasing graphical processing unit (GPU) chips to mine new blocks, to verify transactions.

As a result, Ethereum developers have long predicted that the merge will be unpopular with miners and have taken steps to prevent their intervention, including the implementation of a “difficulty bomb” that will make it far more difficult to mine new blocks. While miners cannot block the merger, they can copy Ethereum and build a different network where the change never occurs. Whether they can convince anyone to use their forked version is the question. Guo has structure here. He was associated with forking Ethereum in July 2016, which brought about the development of Ethereum Classic. Presently Guo needs to rehash the accomplishment by obtaining sufficient hash power — a proportion of crypto mining yield — and persuading different excavators to go along with him.

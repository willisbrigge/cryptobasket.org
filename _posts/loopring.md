## Introduction
Loopring's L2 provides a low-fee, high-speed platform for trading, swapping, liquidity providing, and payments - without sacrificing Ethereum security at all. Its L2 provides a low-fee, high-speed platform for trading, swapping, liquidity providing, and payments - without sacrificing Ethereum security at all. Loopring builds protocols, infrastructure, and user-facing products for the future of finance. We believe this future is built on Ethereum, and specifically on layer 2 (zkRollups).

## Features
1. Loopring is an open-sourced, audited, and non-custodial exchange and payment protocol. Nobody in the Loopring ecosystem needs to trust others. zkRollup assures assets are always under users' own control; 100% Ethereum-level security guarantees.
2. Loopring powers highly scalable decentralized exchanges and payments by batch-processing thousands of requests off-chain, with verifiably correct execution via ZKPs. The performance of Ethereum is no longer the bottleneck.
3. Loopring performs most operations, including trade and transfer settlement, off the Ethereum blockchain. This dramatically reduces gas consumption and overall transaction cost to small fractions of comparable on-chain cost.

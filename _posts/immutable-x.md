## Introduction

Immutable X is the first layer two (L2) scaling solution for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum, with
instant trading, massive scalability and zero gas fees for minting and trading, all without compromising user
or asset security. Immutable X is the most technically advanced solution for NFT scaling ever built, developed
with StarkWareâ€™s powerful STARK prover and rollup technology. The IMX token is the native ERC20 utility token
of the Immutable X protocol, which users can earn by conducting pro-network activities such as trading, and
which can be used to pay fees, perform governance or stake on the protocol. 

## Features
2. Zero gas fees for peer to peer trading.
3. Fast-track your product with Immutable X Mint, a secure way to create and distribute assets on a massive scale.

4. Experience zero gas fees, instant trades, and carbon neutral NFTs for marketplaces, games, and applications without compromise.
